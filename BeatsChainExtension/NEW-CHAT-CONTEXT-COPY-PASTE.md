# 🎵 BeatsChain Extension - Context for New Chat

**Project**: Chrome extension for minting music NFTs with built-in licensing  
**Status**: Production v8 ready with critical user input override issue  
**Tech Stack**: Next.js, Thirdweb SDK, Chrome AI APIs, Polygon Mumbai testnet  

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: User Input Override
**Problem**: AI system overrides user-selected genre in final license generation  
**Impact**: Violates "user as source of truth" principle - users lose control over creative content  
**Files**: popup.js, chrome-ai.js, audio-manager.js need user input priority fixes  

## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES
- Real blockchain integration (Mumbai testnet, no mock data)
- 6-step radio submission flow with cover image upload
- CSP compliance (no inline scripts)
- Split sheets validation (100% single contributor fixed)
- Profile tab available in top navigation for artist biographies
- Dual architecture: Web3 (NFT minting) + Web2 (radio submission)

## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION STRATEGY: LEAN APPROACH
**Decision**: Authentication deferred to final phase  
**Current**: Basic Google Sign-in, Chrome storage, wallet generation  
**Rationale**: Focus on core features first, avoid over-engineering  
**Profile Tab**: Already available for artist biographies  

## 🛡️ SECURITY GAPS (Blocking Production)
- File upload vulnerabilities (magic number validation missing)
- IPFS security risks (unencrypted storage, no access control)
- Input validation gaps (XSS prevention incomplete)

## 📋 MANDATORY DEV RULES
1. **NO DOWNGRADES ALLOWED** - Only comprehensive enhancements
2. **USER AS SOURCE OF TRUTH** - User inputs override AI analysis ⚠️ VIOLATED
3. **NO MOCK DATA** - Real blockchain integration required
4. **PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT** - Extend existing, never replace
5. **SECURITY FIRST** - XSS, CSRF, injection prevention

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
**Phase 1 (IMMEDIATE)**: Fix user input override - UserInputManager class, AI advisory mode  
**Phase 2**: Enhanced radio system - rich biographies, dual IPFS architecture  
**Phase 3**: Security fixes - file upload security, IPFS encryption  
**Phase 4**: Authentication enhancement - multi-factor, role-based access

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
Fix user input override where AI overwrites user-selected genre in license generation. User choice must take priority over AI analysis in all outputs.
