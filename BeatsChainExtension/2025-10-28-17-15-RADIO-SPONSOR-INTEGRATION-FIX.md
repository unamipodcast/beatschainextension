# Radio Sponsor Integration Fix - 2025-10-28-17-15

## Issue
Warning: "Radio sponsor integration not available comprehensive fix, study mint system at isrc"

## Problem
ISRC manager couldn't trigger radio sponsor content after ISRC generation due to missing integration availability checks.

## Solution
Enhanced `triggerRadioSponsorContent()` method in ISRC manager with:
- Multiple fallback paths for finding radio sponsor integration
- Automatic initialization if integration is missing
- Comprehensive error handling

## Files Modified
- `/lib/isrc-manager.js` - Enhanced radio sponsor integration checks

## Result
ISRC generation now properly triggers radio sponsor content with mint system pattern compatibility.
