   - Made authentication mandatory for minting workflow
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback
   - Enhanced Google sign-in with success/error notifications

#### **Key Changes**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken - Authentication Bypass)
} catch (error) {
    console.log('Auth manager unavailable, continuing without authentication');
}

// AFTER (Fixed - Authentication Required)
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Authentication manager initialization failed:', error);
    this.showAuthenticationRequired();
    return;
}
```

```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken - Temporary Wallets)
if (!walletAddress) {
    const tempWallet = '0x' + Array.from(crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(20)), 
        byte => byte.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
    walletAddress = tempWallet;
}

// AFTER (Fixed - Real Authentication Required)
if (!walletAddress) {
    throw new Error('Authentication required: Please sign in to mint NFTs');
}
```
