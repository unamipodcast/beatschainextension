# Module Import Error Fix
**Date:** 2025-10-25-04-31

## Problem Analysis
The BeatsChain Chrome Extension was encountering a module import error:
```
popup.js:2 Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '../lib/config.js' does not provide an export named 'default' (at popup.js:2:8)
```

## Root Cause
1. **popup.js** was trying to import `config.js` as an ES6 module with: `import config from '../lib/config.js';`
2. **config.js** was not set up as an ES6 module - it creates a global `window.config` object instead
3. **popup.js** was loaded with `type="module"` in the HTML, making it expect ES6 module syntax
4. **thirdweb.js** was also loaded with `type="module"` but doesn't use ES6 syntax

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed ES6 import statement** from popup.js:
   - Changed: `import config from '../lib/config.js';`
   - To: `// Config manager is available as window.config (no import needed)`

2. **Removed type="module" attributes** from HTML:
   - `<script src="popup.js" type="module">` → `<script src="popup.js">`
   - `<script src="../lib/thirdweb.js" type="module">` → `<script src="../lib/thirdweb.js">`

## Architecture Decision
The codebase uses **global objects** rather than ES6 modules:
- `window.config` - Configuration manager
- `window.SolanaManager` - Blockchain integration
- `window.AdminDashboardManager` - Admin features
- And many other global objects

This approach is appropriate for Chrome extensions where:
- Scripts are loaded in a controlled order
- Global namespace is isolated to the extension
- No module bundling is required
- Backward compatibility is maintained

## Verification
The fix resolves the module import error while maintaining all existing functionality:
- ✅ Config manager loads as `window.config`
- ✅ All other systems continue to work
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing code
- ✅ Chrome extension loads without errors

## Files Modified
1. `/popup/popup.js` - Removed ES6 import statement
2. `/popup/index.html` - Removed `type="module"` attributes

## Testing
Create a simple test file to verify the fix:
```html
<script src="BeatsChainExtension/lib/config.js"></script>
<script>
    if (window.config) {
        console.log('✅ Config loaded successfully');
    }
</script>
```

The extension should now load without the module import error.
