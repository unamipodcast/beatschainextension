## 🚨 CRITICAL MISSING COMPONENTS IDENTIFIED

### 1. SAMRO SPLIT SHEETS INTEGRATION (CRITICAL)
**Status**: PDF exists but NOT integrated into radio packages

**Current Issue**:
- `Composer-Split-Confirmation.pdf` exists in extension root
- Radio packages missing official SAMRO documentation
- South African music rights compliance incomplete

**Required Implementation**:
```javascript
// In generateRadioPackage() method
async loadSamroSplitSheet() {
    const response = await fetch(chrome.runtime.getURL('Composer-Split-Confirmation.pdf'));
    return await response.blob();
}

// Add to radio package files array
if (this.samroManager) {
    files.push({
        name: 'samro/Composer-Split-Confirmation.pdf',
        content: await this.loadSamroSplitSheet()
    });
}
```

**Impact**: Without this, radio submissions are not fully SAMRO compliant for South African market.

### 2. ADMIN DASHBOARD CLEANUP (REQUIRED)
**Status**: Biography section incorrectly placed in admin dashboard

**Current Issue**:
Admin dashboard contains extensive Artist Biography & Press Kit section that should only be in Profile section for regular users.

**Required Changes**:
- Remove biography fields from admin dashboard
- Keep only admin-specific functions:
  - User management and invitations
  - Analytics and system monitoring  
  - Sponsor content management
  - System configuration

**Code Location**: Admin dashboard in `popup/index.html` and `lib/admin-dashboard.js`

### 3. ARTIST INVITATION SYSTEM VERIFICATION (NEEDS TESTING)
**Status**: Implemented but requires comprehensive end-to-end testing

**Current Implementation**:
```html
🎵 Invite Other Artists
▶ [Collapsible section]
Artist Email: [input field]
Personal Message: [textarea]
📧 Send Invitation
```

**Testing Requirements**:
- ✅ Email validation working
- ✅ Mailto link generation  
- ✅ Message customization
- ❓ **NEEDS TESTING**: End-to-end invitation flow
- ❓ **NEEDS TESTING**: Recipient experience
- ❓ **NEEDS TESTING**: Spam prevention effectiveness

### 4. ADMIN DASHBOARD COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT (INVESTIGATION REQUIRED)
**Status**: Full functionality review needed

**Current Admin Features**:
- Analytics dashboard (package counts, user metrics)
- Sponsor content management (3 sponsors configured)
- User management (admin invitations)
- System monitoring (performance metrics)

**Audit Checklist**:
- [ ] Verify all analytics are accurate
- [ ] Test sponsor content integration
- [ ] Validate admin invitation system
- [ ] Check system monitoring functionality
- [ ] Test all configuration options
